## Setup
1. Clone the repository or download the script files.
2. Install the required Python packages using `pip` (see [Installation](#installation) below).
3. Run the script to start the initial scraping process.

## Installation
To install the necessary packages, run:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Usage
Run the main script to start the initial scraping process:
```bash
python Leaders-Blog.py
python Leaders-Dossier.py
python Leaders-Hommage.py
python Leaders-Lifestyle.py
python Leaders-News.py
python Leaders-Notes.py
python Leaders-Opinion.py
python Leaders-Success.py
python Leaders-TV.py
python Leaders-Who.py
```
The scripts will scrape articles from the different sections save the data into json files. 

## Scheduled Scraping
The schedule module is used to run the scraping job every hour. You can adjust the frequency of the job by modifying the schedule.every().hour.do(job) line each file

## JSON Output Structure
The scraped data is stored in json files with the following structure:
```json
{
    "nom de la presse":"Leaders",
    "categories"{
        "name of the section"{
            "articles":[
                {
                    "url": "https://www.leaders.com.tn/article-url",
                    "title": "Article Title",
                    "contenu": "Full article content",
                    "auteur": "Author name",
                    "tags": [
                        "URL1",
                        "URL2"
                    ],
                    "date_publish": "DD.MM.YYYY"
                    
                },
            ]
        }
    }
    
}

```
## Configuration File
The config.json files are used to store the last page scraped for each category. This allows the scraper to resume from where it left off in subsequent runs.
## Logging
The script uses the logging module to log the scraping process. Logs include information about fetched URLs, warnings for missing pages, and errors during the scraping process.
